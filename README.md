## 🔍 About the Project

**BharatBill** is built to solve a critical pain point for the Indian freelance and small business community: **Professionalism meets Localization.** 

Standard global invoicing tools often lack support for GSTIN, INR symbols, and UPI-based payment tracking. BharatBill bridges this gap by providing an end-to-end platform where businesses can manage clients, generate beautiful GST-compliant PDFs, and track payments through a dedicated portal.

---

## ⚙️ How it Works

BharatBill operates as a centralized hub connecting **Businesses** (Service Providers) and their **Clients**.

### 🔄 The System Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Biz as Business / Freelancer
    participant DB as MongoDB Atlas
    participant Srv as Node.js Backend (Vercel)
    participant Client as Client Portal (Vercel)

    Biz->>Srv: Registers Business & Sets UPI/GST Details
    Biz->>Srv: Adds New Client to Database
    Biz->>Srv: Creates Invoice (Selects Template)
    Srv->>Srv: Renders PDF using Puppeteer
    Srv->>DB: Saves Invoice Data
    Srv-->>Biz: Notifies "Invoice Created"
    
    Client->>Srv: Logs in to Client Portal
    Client->>Srv: Views/Downloads Invoice PDF
    Client->>Srv: Uploads Payment Proof (UTR/Transaction ID)
    Srv->>DB: Updates Invoice Status to "Pending Verification"
    
    Biz->>Srv: Verifies Payment in Dashboard
    Srv->>DB: Marks Invoice as "Paid"
    Srv-->>Client: Confirmation of Payment Received
```

## ✨ Core Modules

### 1. 💼 Business Dashboard
The nerves of the application. Business users (Freelancers or Agencies) get a high-level overview of their financial health.
- **Real-time Analytics**: Bar charts and line graphs (via Recharts) showing monthly revenue vs. outstanding payments.
- **Product Management**: Maintain a catalog of services/products with predefined rates and tax categories.

### 2. 📄 Invoice Engine
A sophisticated PDF generator that doesn't just "print a page."
- **Multiple Templates**: Switch between Standard, Modern, Minimal, Corporate, and Creative styles.
- **GST Compliance**: Automatic calculation of CGST, SGST, and IGST based on client location.
- **Automated PDFs**: Uses a headless Chromium instance (Puppeteer) to ensure pixel-perfect rendering from HTML templates.

### 3. 👥 Client Management & Portal
Instead of sending static emails, give your clients a home.
- **Self-Signup**: Clients can request to be added to your business database.
- **Payment History**: A complete ledger for clients to see what they've paid and what's remaining.
- **Document Hub**: A centralized place for clients to download current and past invoices.

### 4. 🛡️ Authentication & Security
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Stateless authentication for both business users and clients.
- **Role-Based Access**: Strict separation between Business features and Client Portal data.
- **Secure Hashing**: Bcrypt integration ensuring user passwords never leave the database as plain text.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js installed locally.
- A MongoDB cluster (Atlas recommended for cloud deployment).

### Local Setup

1. **Clone & Install**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abiram08/Invoice-Generator-Tracker.git
   cd Invoice-Generator-Tracker
   npm install && cd backend && npm install
   ```

2. **Backend Config (`backend/.env`)**
   ```env
   PORT=5000
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri
   JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
   FRONTEND_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000
   ```

3. **Frontend Config (`.env`)**
   ```env
   REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
   ```

4. **Run**
   ```bash
   # Window 1 (Backend)
   cd backend && npm run dev
   # Window 2 (Frontend)
   npm start
   ```

### ☁️ Vercel Deployment

Both components are optimized for Vercel. 
- **Frontend**: Automatically detected as a React application.
- **Backend**: Configure the `backend` directory with a `vercel.json` if necessary, or deploy as a standalone serverless function.
